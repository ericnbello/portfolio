      `I’m a developer looking for a new role in an exciting company, while also available for freelance work. I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices with frameworks like Tailwind to cut down on styling time, and writing clean JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use Next.js, a React framework, but I can adapt to whatever tools are required.`,
      `From an early age, I've been interested in web application development - which led me to receive a bachelor degree in computer engineering in addition to starting multiple e-commerce stores. Between all of this, I've been able to code in React, Python, Java, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, and C++, to name a few.`,
      `However, when I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors. I’m based in Miami, FL, so I love being out in nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or kayak adventure.`,
